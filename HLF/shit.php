					<p class='content'>This release includes a new lesson in the Deployment trail that describes how to use the Java packaging tools to generate self-contained applications. Self-contained applications are Java applications that are bundled with the JRE that is needed to run. These applications are installed on a user's local drive and launched in the same way as native applications. See Deploying Self-Contained Applications for more information.</p>
